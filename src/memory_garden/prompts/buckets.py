# bucket (工作/职业/事业) or, with a weak model, all landing in 未分类. Tuned for a
# COMPANION app (not a notes tool): emotion / relationship / preferences / pets /
# values matter more than tidy productivity folders. NOT a hard taxonomy — the model
# still creates a specific bucket (妈妈 / 某个朋友) when none of these fit. Each pair
# is the SAME bucket in the two garden languages; never let 工作 and Work coexist —
# use the side matching the user's language. Seven can edit this list (and the
# guidance below) without touching execution code; everything downstream derives
# from it, so there's a single source of truth.
